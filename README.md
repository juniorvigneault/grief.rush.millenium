# Grief Rush Millenium
#### by Junior

This project intends to gamify the grieving process through a speculative experimental game. Exploring the linear five stages of grief model by Swiss psychiatrist KÃ¼bler-Ross, players are accompanied through their grieving process, and encounter different gamification methods such as achievements, status and mastery. Made by Junior Vigneault as a Student Research Assistant during summer 2021.
