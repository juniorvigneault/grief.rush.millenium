# Grief Rush Millenium

This project explores gamification through the grieving process in a speculative experimental game. Based on the linear five stages of grief model by Swiss psychiatrist KÃ¼bler-Ross, players are accompanied through their grieving process, and encounter different gamification methods such as achievements, status and mastery.
