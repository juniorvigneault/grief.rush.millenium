    <h5>Dear journal,</h5>
    (Most of this is a transcript from my <a href="https://juniorvigneault.github.io/grief_project/process/journal_scans.html">handwritten journal</a> but also added notes of me reflecting on me reading my journal and trying to analyse what was going on in my head at that time thus making it somewhat interesting for other people).
    <br>
    <br>
    So i'm making an experimental online game and getting paid for it. This will be the documentation/journal tracking down my ideas and psychological state (I'm hoping to learn about myself and my design patterns (good and bad)) throughout the
    project.
    <br>
    <br>
    I should say that I had already started to think and write a lot about the idea when I got the email explaining the speculative and critical aspect of the research. I think I misunderstood when I read we had to settle on a common theme BEFORE
    starting to work (on the specific idea), and I had a pretty good and fleshed out idea when our team met for the first time, only to find out my idea had (almost) nothing to do with death (the theme we decided to settle on). I mean it did have
    something to do with death in a stretchy philosophical and very general way like everything IS kind of about death in a way but no. All of that did serve me though because I kept the general concept of how I want my game to PLAY out and I
    remembered who I was (partly). Oh BTW everything <span class="important">highlighted in orange means it's VERY important.</span>
  </div>
  <br>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <h4 class="important">Brainstorming</h4>
  <br>
  <br>
  <div class="part2">
    At this stage I started to list themes (about random future scenarios from which I could build something from) that interested me (at this point I had no idea we had to settle on common grounds (death))
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Automation and work (people becoming more intelligent and less physical like in the future everyone has good ideas but no one knows how to actually build them. Getting away from the physical actions and more in our heads and
        stuff. Physical stuff being replaced by automation.</li>
      <li>Relationships and human contact (not meeting people anymore, or having trouble finding people around you that are similar)</li>
      <li class="important">Everything being faster and shorter and more intense (like we need to be showered with intense shit to stay focused from beginning to end of something)</li>
      <li>Watching people do things and live their lives (obsessing over what people are doing and developing a weird one sided relationship with people who share their lives online)</li>
      <li>Having access to everything all the time</li>
    </ul>

    Then after that I felt everything seemed like good potential ideas but nothing REAALLY excited me that much so I went back to more basic questions about my work and felt the need to list stuff that make me laugh or that I find interesting in
    more general sense.
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Bold contrasts</li>
      <li>Randomness (haven't really explored that yet but makes me laugh in other peoples work)</li>
      <li>Giving personality to inanimate things/objects/pictures</li>
    </ul>
    After that I spent an hour developing a weird idea where a chair with a wig on top pretends to be human on social media and has a huge following and pictures with other pieces of furniture with wigs in awesome places and stuff. And then at
    one point someone (the player, yourself) would figure out the (obvious) secret and reveal it's <strong>true </strong>identity. Anyway that did not make much sense and I absolutely did not want to spend more time on it so I decided to forget about
    that.
    <br>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h4 class="important">More Brainstorming</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    So apparently now I'm just going to make a big list of random things/ideas I could explore related to speculative design and the future in general
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Beauty guru has big online following but hides a huge secret; they're a chair (was still holding on to that it seems)</li>
      <li>Death? People don't die anymore. (I had predicted that would maybe be our theme...)</li>
      <li>Being with a group of strangers and interacting with them. Living a party. With people. Inside.</li>
      <li>People have less babies so they over protect them</li>
      <li>People are less creative/not creative anymore</li>
      <li>Less manual labor</li>
      <li>Individual smaller liberties are more important than the whole picture liberties (deep)</li>
      <li>People are more socially awkward</li>
      <li>More violence and sex on tv/movie (I actually don't think thats true anymore, It's just something my parents said in the 90s)</li>
      <li>Beauty gurus (again)</li>
      <li>Online streaming (?)</li>
      <li>Individual experiences vs group experiences</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    THEN, I thought of this very useful question that helped me a LOT:
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong class="question1">What keeps getting more and more intense technologically that I experience daily that I could push to the extreme?</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    Like it would start like small and normal and something we all know from the past/present and become more and more intense and from the future. To create like an arch of intensity that builds to a climax both serious and hilarious. ALSO, I wanted
    to make it so that I could compartmentalize each step and add more if I wanted or just focus on 3 or whatever... You know (I'm speaking to YOU), like I felt like I would have more control if I knew that I had a beginning and an end and the middle
    part was multiple individual different things (like each would be a small game or project) that I would imagine on the fly depending on where the project is and what it needs. ANYWAY.
    <br>
    <br>
    <u>So I made a list.</u>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Ads - They're everywhere. It could be a quest to travel in a maze of pop-ups and ads in order to find the answer to the darkest secrets of the universe)
      </li>
      <br>
      <li> <span class="important">Gamification of apps to motivate us to do things or to give us more emotions.</span> Like gamifying a dating app to make it more epic and dangerous to enhance the experience and create stronger bonds between people.
        Like saving your Tinder match
        from
        being eaten by underwater creatures and if they die then you loose your match for ever. Active serious consequences of not winning (and winning makes it more intense between both)
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Security checks when logging on things (captcha). You create a profile or something and at first the questions are casual (name and password and whatev) and there is a regular captcha at the end (like the weird crossed letters or something)
        and then another one appears when you do it right and another one and it becomes harder and weirder and bigger (like a first person shooter and ethical questions about who to save and stuff), eventually questioning what it means to be human
        (since it's trying to understand if you are human and not a robot)</li>
      <br>
      <li> Minimalism - Making an epic medieval 2d 3rd person minimalist adventure game with only white backgrounds and jQuery elements but with realistic sounds and big orchestral music
      </li>
    </ul>
    So I had decided to go with the Captcha idea but then we settled on death and like I said I could have tried to make it work but if felt like a stretch and took the opportunity to start with a clean slate although it made me kind of anxious cause
    I felt like I had had a big process coming up to that idea and had to start that (almost) all over again. But now it's July 14th and I got my IDEA. And i'm not going to CHANGE IT. Because I like it and I'm excited to bring it to life because it's
    stupid. But before I get into that, MORE LISTS!!
    <br>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h4 class="important">DEATH</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>DEATH but something else?
        <ul>
          <li>Being dead inside (a lot of people)</li>
          <li>The ending of something</li>
          <li>Cremation</li>
          <li>Cemetary</li>
          <li>Horror</li>
          <li>Surprise</li>
          <li>Heaven/Hell</li>
          <li>Time passing</li>
          <li>Unplugging someone simulation (oh my god hahaha)</li>
          <li>Social media after death</li>
          <li>Weapons and crime</li>
          <li><span class="important">Grief</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Robotize everything about death. Make it not emotional like using voice API to make a speech about your deceased loved one
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Trying to play something/do something but keep getting pop-up ads
        <br>
        (I think I was traumatized by pop-ups when I was a kid. My dad would watch porn on the family computer (ew) and one time my friend and I were playing Marine Malice (a VERY
        underrated cereal box game) and some really sexually explicit pop-ups started attacking us. I need to create something about that someday cause it could be really funny)
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>You try to plan someone's funeral online (or your own). Starts by filling out a form but keep getting pop-ups trying to profit on the fact you just lost someone (and using the information you put in the form to get you to buy stuff) (It's
        so
        weird that i'm obsessed with being interrupted by pop-ups, I guess i'm really traumatized)</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>July 20 / 2021</h3>
  <div class="july_20_2021">
    <h5>Dear journal,</h5> So I settled on an idea while talking to my best friend about the fact that I felt like I was falling in the same rabbit hole as previous projects; overthinking things and loosing the funk. Talking with her is always nice
    because we
    want to feel the same type of feeling when making art and want people to feel the same way too, if that makes sense. When we start rambling ideas and something is good, we get really excited and mutually hype each other by adding ideas and
    digging deeper into the concept. So that happened and it gave me the rush I needed to settle on <em>this</em> idea.
    <br>
    <br>
    We talked about an idea I had about gamification earlier on, a concept I briefly explored in my interactive design class last semester. It's so weird that we feel the need to get stimulated by a sort of game to do certain things. We are basically
    tricking ourselves into
    doing stuff we don't have the motivation to do on our own. I mean I do understand it because I use it (not really in apps although I do get it to) but in my everyday life. Like for example me and my best friend play this game where if our other
    friend and roommate is still sleeping after 2 pm (it happens often) then everything we do (tasks or work or whatever) is worth more (in our heads) so we try to make the less noise possible to not wake her up and accomplish stuff really fast after
    that. It's kind of a real life gamification thingy but It's more to make us laugh although it does make me do more stuff.
    <br>
    <br>
    The idea of gamifying something around death sounded really interesting and fun to me, making a "serious" tool in ridiculous ways to deal with a very dark subject seems like something freaky I'd be into. I do think that gamification is something
    that will be implemented even more than it already is (although I have literally nothing to back this statement up haha. But i'm sure this is somewhat true, but i'll make more research)
    <br>
    <br>
    So talking to my bestie about that made me backtrack to an idea I had about the 5 stages of grief. I thought: OH! This could easily be 5 levels of something. I like the idea of having to do 5 small different things. It's comforting. It's
    different. It's very Gemini. I could make a video game to make someone go through their own grief as like a weird speculative ultra-gamified app for people who don't have the motivation or have time to deal with grief and want to go through it
    themselves in a timely or "normal" way.
    <br>
    <br>
    This also ties in nicely with the fact that people have less and less time to do stuff and want to get rid of certain things fast and need external motivation to do something. It's very capitalistic fast
    fast no time for emotion time is money, but to push that into dealing with death is absurd and funny and makes the whole thing kind of outrageous. Download this app and go through your grief in 10 minutes! or something. ALSO : I also think it's
    interesting to talk about how we need ACTION and things to be entertained, lights, flashing stuff, explosions, sounds and music, big shiny things bang bang CONGRADULATIONS you are now grief-free here is an limited edition plush avatar of your
    deceased loved one wouhhouuuuu people screaming some are crying, STOP.
    <br>
    <br>
    Our attention span is sooo low now thanks to our phones and apps like Tik-Tok (I was on youtube today and realized that all the most viewed and trending videos were almost all under 10 seconds). <span class="important">I think that not having
      enough time and motivation
      to deal with grief and needing to be extremely entertained in an ridiculous way to go through the grieving process is a speculative extreme I want to explore, making death this absurd thing we don't have time to deal with.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    More to come about the actual game details SOON.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thank you for reading me, my loves. Big kisses (of death).
