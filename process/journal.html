  <h3>July 14 / 2021</h3>
  <div class="july_14_2021">
    <h5>Dear journal,</h5>
    (Most of this is a transcript from my <a href="https://juniorvigneault.github.io/grief_project/process/journal_scans.html">handwritten journal</a> but also added notes of me reflecting on me reading my journal and trying to analyse what was going
    on in my head at that time thus making it somewhat interesting for other people).
    <br>
    <br>
    So i'm making an experimental online game and getting paid for it. This will be the documentation/journal tracking down my ideas and psychological state (I'm hoping to learn about myself and my design patterns (good and bad)) throughout the
    project.
    <br>
    <br>
    I should say that I had already started to think and write a lot about the idea when I got the email explaining the speculative and critical aspect of the research. I think I misunderstood when I read we had to settle on a common theme BEFORE
    starting to work (on the specific idea), and I had a pretty good and fleshed out idea when our team met for the first time, only to find out my idea had (almost) nothing to do with death (the theme we decided to settle on). I mean it did have
    something to do with death in a stretchy philosophical and very general way like everything IS kind of about death in a way but no. All of that did serve me though because I kept the general concept of how I want my game to PLAY out and I
    remembered who I was (partly). Oh BTW everything <span class="important">highlighted in orange means it's VERY important.</span>
  </div>
  <br>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <h4 class="important">Brainstorming</h4>
  <br>
  <br>
  <div class="part2">
    At this stage I started to list themes (about random future scenarios from which I could build something from) that interested me (at this point I had no idea we had to settle on common grounds (death))
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Automation and work (people becoming more intelligent and less physical like in the future everyone has good ideas but no one knows how to actually build them. Getting away from the physical actions and more in our heads and
        stuff. Physical stuff being replaced by automation.</li>
      <li>Relationships and human contact (not meeting people anymore, or having trouble finding people around you that are similar)</li>
      <li class="important">Everything being faster and shorter and more intense (like we need to be showered with intense shit to stay focused from beginning to end of something)</li>
      <li>Watching people do things and live their lives (obsessing over what people are doing and developing a weird one sided relationship with people who share their lives online)</li>
      <li>Having access to everything all the time</li>
    </ul>

    Then after that I felt everything seemed like good potential ideas but nothing REAALLY excited me that much so I went back to more basic questions about my work and felt the need to list stuff that make me laugh or that I find interesting in
    more general sense.
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Bold contrasts</li>
      <li>Randomness (haven't really explored that yet but makes me laugh in other peoples work)</li>
      <li>Giving personality to inanimate things/objects/pictures</li>
    </ul>
    After that I spent an hour developing a weird idea where a chair with a wig on top pretends to be human on social media and has a huge following and pictures with other pieces of furniture with wigs in awesome places and stuff. And then at
    one point someone (the player, yourself) would figure out the (obvious) secret and reveal it's <strong>true </strong>identity. Anyway that did not make much sense and I absolutely did not want to spend more time on it so I decided to forget about
    that.
    <br>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h4 class="important">More Brainstorming</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    So apparently now I'm just going to make a big list of random things/ideas I could explore related to speculative design and the future in general
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Beauty guru has big online following but hides a huge secret; they're a chair (was still holding on to that it seems)</li>
      <li>Death? People don't die anymore. (I had predicted that would maybe be our theme...)</li>
      <li>Being with a group of strangers and interacting with them. Living a party. With people. Inside.</li>
      <li>People have less babies so they over protect them</li>
      <li>People are less creative/not creative anymore</li>
      <li>Less manual labor</li>
      <li>Individual smaller liberties are more important than the whole picture liberties (deep)</li>
      <li>People are more socially awkward</li>
      <li>More violence and sex on tv/movie (I actually don't think thats true anymore, It's just something my parents said in the 90s)</li>
      <li>Beauty gurus (again)</li>
      <li>Online streaming (?)</li>
      <li>Individual experiences vs group experiences</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    THEN, I thought of this very useful question that helped me a LOT:
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong class="question1">What keeps getting more and more intense technologically that I experience daily that I could push to the extreme?</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    Like it would start like small and normal and something we all know from the past/present and become more and more intense and from the future. To create like an arch of intensity that builds to a climax both serious and hilarious. ALSO, I wanted
    to make it so that I could compartmentalize each step and add more if I wanted or just focus on 3 or whatever... You know (I'm speaking to YOU), like I felt like I would have more control if I knew that I had a beginning and an end and the middle
    part was multiple individual different things (like each would be a small game or project) that I would imagine on the fly depending on where the project is and what it needs. ANYWAY.
    <br>
    <br>
    <u>So I made a list.</u>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Ads - They're everywhere. It could be a quest to travel in a maze of pop-ups and ads in order to find the answer to the darkest secrets of the universe)
      </li>
      <br>
      <li> <span class="important">Gamification of apps to motivate us to do things or to give us more emotions.</span> Like gamifying a dating app to make it more epic and dangerous to enhance the experience and create stronger bonds between people.
        Like saving your Tinder match
        from
        being eaten by underwater creatures and if they die then you loose your match for ever. Active serious consequences of not winning (and winning makes it more intense between both)
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Security checks when logging on things (captcha). You create a profile or something and at first the questions are casual (name and password and whatev) and there is a regular captcha at the end (like the weird crossed letters or something)
        and then another one appears when you do it right and another one and it becomes harder and weirder and bigger (like a first person shooter and ethical questions about who to save and stuff), eventually questioning what it means to be human
        (since it's trying to understand if you are human and not a robot)</li>
      <br>
      <li> Minimalism - Making an epic medieval 2d 3rd person minimalist adventure game with only white backgrounds and jQuery elements but with realistic sounds and big orchestral music
      </li>
    </ul>
    So I had decided to go with the Captcha idea but then we settled on death and like I said I could have tried to make it work but if felt like a stretch and took the opportunity to start with a clean slate although it made me kind of anxious cause
    I felt like I had had a big process coming up to that idea and had to start that (almost) all over again. But now it's July 14th and I got my IDEA. And i'm not going to CHANGE IT. Because I like it and I'm excited to bring it to life because it's
    stupid. But before I get into that, MORE LISTS!!
    <br>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h4 class="important">DEATH</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>DEATH but something else?
        <ul>
          <li>Being dead inside (a lot of people)</li>
          <li>The ending of something</li>
          <li>Cremation</li>
          <li>Cemetary</li>
          <li>Horror</li>
          <li>Surprise</li>
          <li>Heaven/Hell</li>
          <li>Time passing</li>
          <li>Unplugging someone simulation (oh my god hahaha)</li>
          <li>Social media after death</li>
          <li>Weapons and crime</li>
          <li><span class="important">Grief</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Robotize everything about death. Make it not emotional like using voice API to make a speech about your deceased loved one
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Trying to play something/do something but keep getting pop-up ads
        <br>
        (I think I was traumatized by pop-ups when I was a kid. My dad would watch porn on the family computer (ew) and one time my friend and I were playing Marine Malice (a VERY
        underrated cereal box game) and some really sexually explicit pop-ups started attacking us. I need to create something about that someday cause it could be really funny)
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>You try to plan someone's funeral online (or your own). Starts by filling out a form but keep getting pop-ups trying to profit on the fact you just lost someone (and using the information you put in the form to get you to buy stuff) (It's
        so
        weird that i'm obsessed with being interrupted by pop-ups, I guess i'm really traumatized)</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>July 20 / 2021</h3>
  <div class="july_20_2021">
    <h5>Dear journal,</h5> So I settled on an idea while talking to my best friend about the fact that I felt like I was falling in the same rabbit hole as previous projects; overthinking things and loosing the funk. Talking with her is always nice
    because we
    want to feel the same type of feeling when making art and want people to feel the same way too, if that makes sense. When we start rambling ideas and something is good, we get really excited and mutually hype each other by adding ideas and
    digging deeper into the concept. So that happened and it gave me the rush I needed to settle on <em>this</em> idea.
    <br>
    <br>
    We talked about an idea I had about gamification earlier on, a concept I briefly explored in my interactive design class last semester. It's so weird that we feel the need to get stimulated by a sort of game to do certain things. We are basically
    tricking ourselves into
    doing stuff we don't have the motivation to do on our own. I mean I do understand it because I use it (not really in apps although I do get it to) but in my everyday life. Like for example me and my best friend play this game where if our other
    friend and roommate is still sleeping after 2 pm (it happens often) then everything we do (tasks or work or whatever) is worth more (in our heads) so we try to make the less noise possible to not wake her up and accomplish stuff really fast after
    that. It's kind of a real life gamification thingy but It's more to make us laugh although it does make me do more stuff.
    <br>
    <br>
    The idea of gamifying something around death sounded really interesting and fun to me, making a "serious" tool in ridiculous ways to deal with a very dark subject seems like something freaky I'd be into. I do think that gamification is something
    that will be implemented even more than it already is (although I have literally nothing to back this statement up haha. But i'm sure this is somewhat true, but i'll make more research)
    <br>
    <br>
    So talking to my bestie about that made me backtrack to an idea I had about the 5 stages of grief. I thought: OH! This could easily be 5 levels of something. I like the idea of having to do 5 small different things. It's comforting. It's
    different. It's very Gemini. I could make a video game to make someone go through their own grief as like a weird speculative ultra-gamified app for people who don't have the motivation or have time to deal with grief and want to go through it
    themselves in a timely or "normal" way.
    <br>
    <br>
    This also ties in nicely with the fact that people have less and less time to do stuff and want to get rid of certain things fast and need external motivation to do something. It's very capitalistic fast
    fast no time for emotion time is money, but to push that into dealing with death is absurd and funny and makes the whole thing kind of outrageous. Download this app and go through your grief in 10 minutes! or something. ALSO : I also think it's
    interesting to talk about how we need ACTION and things to be entertained, lights, flashing stuff, explosions, sounds and music, big shiny things bang bang CONGRADULATIONS you are now grief-free here is an limited edition plush avatar of your
    deceased loved one wouhhouuuuu people screaming some are crying, STOP.
    <br>
    <br>
    Our attention span is sooo low now thanks to our phones and apps like Tik-Tok (I was on youtube today and realized that all the most viewed and trending videos were almost all under 10 seconds). <span class="important">I think that not having
      enough time and motivation
      to deal with grief and needing to be extremely entertained in an ridiculous way to go through the grieving process is a speculative extreme I want to explore, making death this absurd thing we don't have time to deal with.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    More to come about the actual game details SOON.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thank you for reading me, my loves. Big kisses (of death).

  <h3>August 3 / 2021</h3>
  <div class="august_03_2021">
    <h5>Dear journal,</h5>
    It happened, my expected, usual mid-project crisis. Again. It happened because I stumbled on a small technical detail at the end of a weird emotional day and the feeling evolved into this big weird thing making me question the whole thing. I
    decided to take a small break to think about my project and try to remember what the idea was in the first place. I think i'm struggling also because I don't have a PLAN. I keep writing down MAKE A PLAN in my to-do but never actually do it. Like
    the whole thing is in my head and I like it there and I don't want it to leave there because that would be scary and I think I'm afraid of failure so I don't do things therefore I don't fail (but I do). So now i'm going to make one and stick to
    it (A plan). I'm making one now. For real. I still worked last week though, rest assured dear readers, and figured a lot on the visual and music and general vibe (sooo important to me to get the motivation to move forward), as well as how the
    general play through will unfold. I was kind of lost in the themes that I wanted to talk about but then remembered the extreme gamification and I remembered what I liked about it. So today and tomorrow will be about laying down my plan and
    continuing to build the main structure. It's gonna be great. I know it. Just gotta continue to work and stop doubting my ideas.
    <br>
    <br>
    I know everything seems weird and foggy to you, my dear readers. I'm sorry if i'm not being very clear about what i'm actually doing (which is supposed to be the purpose of this very journal) but I think once my plan is there I'll dive into more
    specific concepts and be able to explain more about what's going on. Also I think my journal entries will be more focused on questions regarding grief and how I want to lay it all out as an experience more than me rambling about everything and
    nothing.
    <br>
    <br>
    Also, I'm probably going to have to work like full time on this (which I'm excited about) because I feel like my usual ''I don't believe in myself'' BS slowed down the process in the last 2 weeks and I don't want that because I want to be the
    best at everything.
    <br>
    <br>
    Also, I met a boy, and we love each other.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thank you for reading me, everyone.

  <h3>August 11 / 2021</h3>

  <div class="august_11_2021">

    <h5>Dear journal,</h5>
    Ok so I did a LOT in the past days and my project is on the roll. I'm skipping through a lot of the design details and stuff
    and focusing more on the general technical ideas and story. The visual aspects are slowly coming together in my mind,
    I'm thinking of doing something really really simple, color blocking, with certain details being very detailed and "realistic". I'm going
    to be making sketches tonight and will prob upload them later.
    <br>
    <br>
    I think I'm changing shifting gears too about the "surprise element", like I wanted to create a realistic
    kind of website and then make this huge contrast between the two. Like serious and calm and soothing and then
    when the game actually starts it's really super intense and complicated and stuff, making it FUNNY. Now I'm
    thinking more making a cohesive simple little app that makes sense altogether, and I'm going to take more time
    to explore how to grieve with simple games.
    <br>
    <br>
    I'm on a roll honnestly, it feels great. I think it's going to be awesome. I'm a little behind in terms of schedule but
    I'm working extra hours to fit it all in. I think it's realistic to have it done by September 1st.
    <br>
    <br>
    Farewell readers, everyone.

  <h3>August 16 / 2021</h3>
  <div class="august_16_2021">
    <h5>Dear journal,</h5>
    So, i'm finally to the point of starting on Denial. The first game. Obviously everything is going to be super simple and poetic.
    Working on the visuals helped me understand where I want to go in terms of simplicity and stuff. So I'm making research on how to cope
    with denial and there are the things I'm figuring out that speak to me :
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Denial is a defense mechanism, it's like your body and mind are buffering the shock because the emotions would be too intense to take at once. So you kind of doubt that the loss event happened. It's like you can't believe it's real in a
        sense</li>
      <li>You go numb for a while</li>
      <li>Nothing matters anymore. Everything is different</li>
      <li>Helps process loss in your own time, so it's different for people (in terms of time)</li>
      <li>Eventually the feelings and emotions that have been denied resurface, and the journey continues. </li>
      <li>Denial is not only an attempt to pretend that the loss dows not exist. We are also trying to absorb and understand what is happening.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    Soooo. How to reference the fundamental ideas of denial in a 10 second game. So in the beginning the emotions are blocked to help you to cope at your own pace.
    You deny the loss. I kinda want to use matter.js again. Let me think. So something could be blocked in the beginning, then you have to unblock it in a way where not
    everything is going through at the same time. So the emotions could be bottled up in a sense. Emotions would maybe be represented as squares in matter.js and surrounded
    by solids like trapped. euuuuuuummm ya ok I would need to think about that. Also I think before the beginning of each game there should be a short explanation, like these squares
    represent emotions or something.
    <br>
    <br>
    Also, I want to keep in mind that i want to make it somewhat funny. So ya. I'ma go checkout the matter.js website to see the examples and try to find something that could be interesting.
    So I think the user could actually block stuff from falling down but let certain ones fall down when they turn another color. Like bouncing circles on a solid are black but when they
    turn another color then you have to let them go past you without letting the others go because they are not ready. ok yeah. Lets do that.

  <h3>August 16 / 2021</h3>
  <div class="august_17_2021">
    <h5>Dear journal,</h5>
    Radom thoughts about my Denial game :
    <ul>
      <li>Instructions at the beginning</li>
      <li>Certain emotions are more dangerous and make the grounds break. Different shape or color</li>
      <li>Different levels? Like 3 maybe? At first it's easy then it's harder. Levels are separated by new instructions about whats coming up next like harder things.</li>
      <li>You win when you get through everything time wise or when you reach a certain amount of points? I think it's cooler if it's time wise and then you can have different amount of points everytime.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h3>August 29 / 2021</h3>
  <div class="august_29_2021">
    <h5>Bonjour cher journal,</h5>
    Again working on my denial game. I think I'm getting too deep in the "It needs to be a fun and just difficult enough video game" instead of making it just interesting and thoughful and reflective of what denial is about input
    in the grieveing process. I lost a lot of time doing that. I have all the visuals "done" for the game and the gameplay stuff is "working" like It is basically already a functional game so I REALLY need to get moving. I'll finish it
    today and write about it after here again. Wish me luck. Bye.
    <br>
    <br>
    FROM ME TO ME :
    <br>
    <br>
    I'm working on my little grieving games and i'm wondering about something. So right now I have a fairly cute and simple game that is relatively easy to get through. I think it's interesting because it makes it seem like going through the process
    is as easy as that (enforcing the kind of ridiculousness of gamifying the grieving process) but I'm wondering if it were more interesting to make the games feel really hard and make the player feel overwhelmed while playing. The player would
    still move to the the next game but wouldn't really get what is going on or why they won (would still be awarded points and stuff, so the gamification aspect would still be there but in a more absurd way). I think that is maybe weirder and
    funnier and also gets the point across but in a different way BUT is less fun to play and doesn't really make the player feel useful. Thoughts?
    <br>
    <br>
    RESPONSE FROM ANGEL :
    <br>
    <br>
    I like both directions quite a bit.
    <br>
    <br>
    I like the idea of the game almost "fooling" the player (or the player fooling themselves? HMM) into thinking grieving as a step-by-step process easily "digestible" via a game. If the cuteness factor is exaggerated, it'd be belittling to the
    player - especially if they realize themselves the ridiculousness of it all. What can I say, I find that interesting XD
    I think it'd also give the project a more 'click bait' vibe and possibly political/financial undertones? Seems interesting to me.
    <br>
    <br>
    But the message would get across with your other approach too; I feel like having the player not feeling particularly useful/accomplished/dynamic is kind of expected? I mean although it's defined as a game, I would think - in a context where I'm
    actually seeking this out as an outlet/shortcut for grieving - I would expect it to have more of a cathartic/therapeutic effect? Kinda like listening to ASMRs to fall asleep XD? You're not there to actually listen to what's being said, you seek
    smth else entirely. Weird way to say, I wouldn't be surprised if, as a player, I don't have to beat bosses and such XD
    I think it'd also add that the player not feeling 'useful' might go perfectly with the whole concept - kind of saying we're powerless against the process of grieving or smth.
    <br>
    <br>
    That was a long rant to say I really like both approaches
    <br>
    <br>
    RESPONSE FROM PIPPIN :
    <br>
    <br>
    My vote is for the version you have right now. I think there's probably more interesting procedural rhetoric in staying with the idea of the app "speeds up" grief, something which we all know can't be sped up. I think it functions as a clearer
    critique that doing something that may be confusing, even if more entertaining. Open to both though!
    I think going for some attempted "realism" is important/interesting in Speculative Play. It's that attempt at fidelity to a future form of software that most clearly leads us to think about where we're headed.

  <h3>September 7 / 2021</h3>
  <div class="september_7_2021">
    <h5>DEAR baby journal,</h5>
    Ok so I didn't write OR commit in a long time and I did a lot on my project. I kind of missed the point of documenting my experience/advancements because I wanted to get things done really fast so it didn't really make sense that I documented
    everything timewise.
    It's probably stupid though because I should have. Anyway. I kind of finished my denial game (except for small details that don't work as intended like stuff in the points system, stuff I don't know how to figure out so I'll need Pippin's help at
    some point).
    Working on my game I was kind of losing the feeling of gamification and making it ridiculous and actually have something to say about something, but then I added the points adding up at the end in a sort of mario bros kind of thing and it really
    gave me the feelings
    I'm looking for. I think I'm going to add a objects that you find through the levels as well, like in the end when the points are calculated then after there is a small gifts that opens itslef like in crossy road. Like you click on the gift and
    the objets appear.
    I think I want all the objects to appear in the title screen once you have them collected, with the total points. I think it could be interesting to make the objects be part of some sort of absurd conclusion when the grieving process is over. Or
    not, maybe they just are
    there and serve absolutely no purpose. TO SEE.
    <br>
    <br>
    Anger phase. So I'm going to start working on the anger level. Hopefully this will be more simple and shorter. I will def use the same systems as the Denial game so that should help. Here is going to be a list of things that speak to me about
    ANGER :
    <ul>
      <li>Being mean to other people</li>
      <li>Agressive towards people/objects/things</li>
    </ul>
    Simple haha.

    <h3>September 9 / 2021</h3>
    <div class="september_9_2021">
      <h5>journaljournaljournal, it is to you I talk,</h5>
      SO. I REALLY WANT TO FINISH THIS PROJECT. Not because I'm over it because strangely I'm still really into it and motivated by it, but because school is coming like the big wave in Interstellar and I can hear the dramatic Hans Zimmer track
      becoming louder and louder and
      it scares me. Also, I want to make good projects and be the perfect student and I can't do that if I'm still working on the project. Sunday is the last that I'll be working on this. It will work, everything will. Everything might not be perfect
      but I will let that go for now.
      Who knows maybe I will work on it more after that to polish certain things. So I'm starting to work on the bargaining game. Here is some information about this step in a list I made:
      <ul>
        <li>You could do anything to bring back your lost person</li>
        <li>If only statements</li>
        <li>What if statements</li>
        <li>Holding on to hope</li>
        <li>Make a deal or a promise (to God)</li>
        <li>Postpone sadness</li>
      </ul>
      So, using Matter.js again, what could I make that would represent this stage and make the player feel like they are going through it. So for the last two examples I went to the Matter.js website and I checked the demos and got inspired by what
      they were featuring. I'll do that. See u in 5.

      Oops, I went to the gym and ate and did groceries and watched an episode of Love Island. I'm back now.

      <br>
      <br>
      I'm going to start by creating a class for bargaining to trick my brain i'm actually working and get these endorphines flowin'.

      So it could be a game where you have to do something and at first you think it's actually doing something but then soon you realize that death is coming anyway and there's nothing you can do about it.
      Like something really simple like taking a block and putting it on something or doing something fast before death arrives. Yes death could be moving slowly towards something and you have to stop it by doing some kind
      of simple task using blocks.

        It's past the moment where I was suppose to stop and it did not happen so this is what I'll do.
        I'll "finish" my 3 first games and make music/sounds and work on the conclusion and it'll be "done" in a sense where I'll be able to share something somewhat finished or at least comprehensible as a general concept.
        Of course I'm planning on finishing the whole thing still because I want to put it in my portfolio, but for now school is literrally screaming in my ears. So i'll be making a list of things I need to finish today and
        finish those things so I can share the produceeeee. So yeah, this list will be my final to do in my to-do list.

          <h5>mon cher journal,</h5>
          Reading about the Kübler-Ross model, I found that it was critiqued a lot for being unrealistic and too linear and not representative of how humans deal with actual loss. That humans experiencing grief is a much more complicated and dirty
          process that can't be enclosed in specific
          and individual separate steps which is really funny because my thing kind of amplifies that. Its so linear and you cant even go back to previous steps (which would be absolutely a normal emotional response from someone grieving).
<br>
<br>
          It kind of makes me want to expose that even more by adding stuff like clicking on the past steps you've completed and the program tells you that you've already completed those and stuff. I'm also looking forward to adding more Gamification
          elements like objects. I think that will be a funny addition. ps: Need to update the about thingy in the start section to mention the critiques of the kubler-ross model because I think that's an interesting thing to point out before playing.
          Back to werk.

          <h3>Mardi le 8 février / 2022</h3>
          <div class="february_8_2022">
            <h5>OK, WO</h5>
            I did A LOT. of work. I changed a lot of stuff. I built a lot.
            Here are the main things I changed :
            - The whole design. I decided to go with a more realistic feel with backgrounds. I also
            put a real human as Sam and not a pixel art thing. I kept the more arcade kind of stuff for the games though.
            - I added music. I created a bunch of similar musical loops for each level. Kind of using similar chords and instruments.
            - I made the game more visually coherent. I felt like the whole thing felt a bit weird and not cohesive. Now things make more sense.
            - I decided on a sort of story arch going through the game. I felt like the whole thing was a bit repetitive and wanted to
            enhance the experience by creating more of a story instead of just games. When the player reaches the bargaining level, the game
            changes it's way of working. It kind of interepupts the experience and tells the player they have a chance to ACTUALLY bring back
            the person they lost if they follow the steps. Turns out death is inevitable and the player goes to the next stage. I believe this
            that trying to make the player believe they might have the chance to bring them back (which is what bargaining actually is when you lose someone
            IRL), it creates a sort of momentum in emotion, because the player no longer knows what will happen if they succeed (they can't but still
            they wonder what could happen). Facing the inevitable then serves the purpose of the next stage : depression.
            - I'm working on depression now. Trying to figure what game it could be. I made the song and the background and I'm trying to read about it
            (depression in the grieving process) but I still don't have much. A lot of it has to do with being lonely and isolating from others and stuff. Wonder
            how I could portray that. I'm thinking it could be fun to introduce something that is controlled with the arrow keys. Maybe like being in the complete
            darkness and looking for help or something. Like a maze. Ya like a dark maze and you don't know where you are going but when you end up at the end
            the level is cleared.
            - Still don't really know how I will end the whole thing. I'm hesitating between making it epic or really dumb. Or something else. Something else, give
            me something else. We'll see when we get there. Kind of excited to be done all levels and concentrate on details and stuff. I think this thing is gonna
            be cool when all polished.
